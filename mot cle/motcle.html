      <h2>techniques and topics that are essential for competitive programming:  </h2>

      <ul>
    <li>Brute force** </li>
    <p>- Is a straightforward and often the simplest approach to solving problems in competitive programming. It involves trying all possible solutions to find the correct one.
    </p>

    <li>Dynamic Programming (DP) </li>
    <p>- A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Key techniques include memoization and tabulation.

    </p> 

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeVNB-XDbSQ">Merge sort Algorithm</a>
        
        
        

<p><a href="../utils/utils.html#fibonacci"></a></p>
    <li> Graph Theory</li>
    <p>- Study of graphs and their properties. Important algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
    </p>

    <li>Number Theory  </li>
    <p>	- Fundamental concepts such as prime numbers, greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), modular arithmetic, and number theoretic functions (Eulerâ€™s Totient function).
    </p>

    <li> Combinatorics </li>
    <p>- Techniques involving permutations, combinations, and the binomial theorem. Understanding Pascal's Triangle and combinatorial identities is also useful.
    </p>

    <li> Sorting and Searching </li>
    <p>- Algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, and binary search. Understanding their time complexities and when to use each.
    </p>

    <li>Greedy Algorithms  </li>
    <p>- Problems that can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each stage. 
        Examples include Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for finding Minimum Spanning Trees.
    </p>

    <li>String Algorithms  </li>
    <p>- Techniques for pattern matching (KMP algorithm, Rabin-Karp algorithm), string hashing, and suffix arrays/trees.
    </p>

    <li>Geometry  </li>
    <p>- Understanding basic geometry concepts, computational geometry algorithms like Convex Hull, line segment intersection, and polygon area calculation.
    </p>

    <li>Bit Manipulation  </li>
    <p>- Using bitwise operations to solve problems more efficiently. Common tasks include finding subsets, bitwise AND/OR, XOR operations, and bit masking.
    </p>

    <li> Backtracking </li>
    <p>	- A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems by incrementally building candidates to the solutions and abandoning a candidate as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.
    </p>

    <li> Advanced Graph Algorithms </li>
    <p>- Such as network flows (Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Edmonds-Karp algorithm), graph coloring, and finding strongly connected components (Kosaraju's algorithm, Tarjan's algorithm).
    </p>

    <li>Mathematical Optimization  </li>
    <p>- Techniques like linear programming and dynamic programming for optimization problems.
    </p>

    <li> Game Theory </li>
    <p>- Study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. Concepts like Minimax algorithm and Nash equilibrium are often useful.
    </p>

    <li>Probabilistic Algorithms  </li>
    <p>- Algorithms that make some decisions randomly (e.g., Randomized QuickSort, Monte Carlo algorithms).
